Tic-Tac-Toe
===========

I was asked to create a Tic Tac Toe game. I started first by creating a stick representation of the game,
but when I started to interact with the game I realized the need for the Ai portion of the game. There are so many good examples to learn how to implement the minimax algorithm. I found code examples in every python book I have almost.
